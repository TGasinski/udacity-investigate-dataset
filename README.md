# udacity-investigate-dataset
This project was part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. For the assignment, I selected a curated dataset from Udacity in order to guide myself through the entire data analysis process. 

# Motivation 
I graduated from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program in April 2020. As part of the program, I was tasked with selecting a dataset and completing the entire data analysis process - Question, Wrangle, Explore, Draw Conclusions, and Communicate. I chose to use data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used by gun shops to check the eligibility of a prospective buyer, as well as state-level demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. I employed both datasets in order to investigate historical trends and socio-economic characteristics associated with gun registrations, with a particular focus on my homestate of Illinois and its neighbor Indiana. Over the past few years, the city of Chicago has seen a rapid increase in the volume of gun-related violence - particularly in 2015 and 2016, which experienced the most murders since 1997 ([source](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/01/us/chicago-murders-2016/index.html)). Many of the guns use in these crimes originate outside of Illinois, from neighboring states like Indiana, who have less stringent gun laws ([source](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-laws-stop-at-state-lines-but-guns-dont/)). Ideally, I would use the NICS dataset in conjungtion with another dataset that could provide more information about the relationship between gun registrations and legislation, e.g. what percentage of attempted gun registrations are rejected by state. This is a great suggestion for someone else to move forward with the project!  

# Project Rubric 
The goal of this project was to: 
+ Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
+ Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
+ Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
+ Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
+ Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
+ Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
+ Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

# Data Sources
The two datasources, the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and the U.S. Census Bureau, were provided by Udacity. The original source of the NICS data can be viewed here: https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/blob/master/README.md

# How to use 
To run the .ipynb file, download the datasets from the /input folder. To view the final output, open the .pdf file.
